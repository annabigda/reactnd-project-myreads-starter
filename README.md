# MyReads Project

This projects simulates a bookshelf, with 3 categories: Currently Reading, Want to read and read.

When changing the book category you should see the changes immediately.

If you set the categorry to None the book will hide, and you will have to search

You can search books by clicking on the `+` icon and search a title, which you can then 
add to your collection.
